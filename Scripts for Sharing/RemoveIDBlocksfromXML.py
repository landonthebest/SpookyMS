RemoveIDBlocksfromXML.py

Purpose:
    This script processes an XML file to selectively remove specific XML elements (imgdir nodes)
    based on their ID attributes. It keeps only the elements with IDs that are listed in a 
    separate file, while removing all others that match certain criteria.

How it works:
    1. Reads a list of IDs to keep from a file named 'IDs'
    2. Parses the input XML file ('Ins.img.xml.modified.xml')
    3. Identifies all imgdir elements with 7-digit IDs that:
       - Start with '301' but not '399'
       - Are NOT in the list of IDs to keep
    4. Removes these identified elements from the XML structure
    5. Writes the modified XML to the output file ('Ins.img.xml')

Input files:
    - Ins.img.xml.modified.xml: The source XML file to process
    - IDs: A text file containing one ID per line, listing IDs that should be kept

Output file:
    - Ins.img.xml: The processed XML file with unwanted elements removed

ID filtering criteria:
    - Only processes elements with 7-digit numeric IDs
    - Only targets IDs that start with '301' but not '399'
    - Removes elements only if their IDs are not in the 'IDs' file

Usage:
    1. Place this script in the same directory as your XML files
    2. Create an 'IDs' file with the list of IDs to keep
    3. Run the script: python RemoveIDBlocksfromXML.py
    4. Alternatively, modify the file paths in the script to point to your specific files
